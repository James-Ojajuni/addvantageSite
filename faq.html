                <p class="faqQuestion">What ROI is realistic if I invest in Fumba Town?</p>
                <div class="answerContainer">
                    <ul class="faqAnswer faqList">
                        <li>In recent years, the average annual property value increase has been around 10%. In prime locations, this increase has reached 20-30%.</li>
                        <li>For long-term rentals, you can expect an ROI of 5%, and in prime locations, up to 10% (depending on the property and investment price)</li>
                        <li>If you rent your property through a service provider, hereâ€™s how the potential ROI can be calculated: The service provider estimates the likely occupancy rate depending on the property and number of rooms. For example, at BORJ or Soul Paje, they project an occupancy rate of up to 68% annually. The service provider calculates a minimum rental price of up to $175 per night for a double room. This can be easily verified on internet platforms like <span class="faqLink">Booking.com</span> for the Soul Paje property.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="faqAnswer">The rental income is split between you and the service provider, with the owner receiving 50-60% of the rental income and the service provider taking 20%. The remaining 20% covers costs and taxes for the owner.</p>
                    <p class="faqAnswer">Example Calculation: Renting out your studio for 240 nights at US$150 per night generates US$36,000 in revenue. The owner would receive US$21,600, and the service provider would receive US$7,200. The remaining $7,200 would cover the 10% tax on rental income in Zanzibar, as well as estimated additional costs. Please note that depending on your country of residence, your earnings might also be subject to tax. In most cases, taxes already paid in Zanzibar can be credited.

                <p class="faqQuestion">How many people can obtain the Golden Visa?</p>
                <div class="answerContainer">
                    <p class="faqAnswer">The Golden Visa can be granted to up to six peopleâ€”typically, the parents and up to four financially dependent children under the age of 20. The only requirement is an investment of at least US$100,000 (approximately â‚¬91,000) in an apartment or house.</p>
                    <p class="faqAnswer">The visa remains valid as long as you own the property. However, the visa in your passport must be renewed every two years, costing US$500 for the primary applicant and US$50 for each additional person. Children over 18 are no longer eligible for a permanent visa through their parentsâ€™ investment. They would need to either make their own investment or obtain a different visa, such as a student visa or a work-related visa. We are happy to provide personalised guidance on this.</p>
                    <p class="faqAnswer">Retirees aged 55+ do not need to invest $100,000 USD to obtain a visa in Zanzibar or Tanzania. Instead, they can apply for a retirement visa, which requires proof of sufficient financial means, such as a pension statement or passive income sources like rental income or interest earnings.</p>

To ensure a reliable power supply, Fumba Town offers an automatic backup power system that activates during outages. This optional service can be added for just $0.09 per sqm per month.</p>
                            <p class="faqAnswer">For a 50sqm apartment, the additional cost for automatic backup power is only $4.50 per month.</p>
                            <p class="faqAnswer">As of December 2024, the electricity price was only 8.9 US cents per kWh.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p class="faqAnswer">In Fumba Town, Zanzibar, every apartment and house is equipped with a fiber-optic connection, ensuring fast and highly reliable internet.  Many international residents work remotely for companies abroad without any issues.</p>
                        <p class="faqAnswer">In contrast, internet service in hotels and tourist areas is often unreliable and may not be sufficient for video conferences or applications requiring a fast connection. However, a local prepaid SIM card offers an affordable and fast LTE internet solution, which can be used to create a hotspot for your computer.</p>

                    <p class="faqAnswer">The Golden Visa is granted for up to six people, usually the parents and up to four financially dependent children under 18. The right to the visa remains as long as you own the house or apartment. The visa in the passport must be renewed every two years and costs $500 USD for the main applicant and $50 USD for each additional person.</p>
                    <p class="faqAnswer">Children over 18 years old can no longer obtain a permanent visa through their parentsâ€™ investment. They must either make their own investment in their name or stay in Tanzania/Zanzibar with their parents using a different type of visa, such as a student visa or a work visa.

                    <p class="faqAnswer">The key advantage is that you wonâ€™t have to deal with paperwork or make upfront payments at doctors or hospitals.

                <p class="faqQuestion">
                    In Fumba Town, about 50% of the houses are built using timber construction. Are there no issues with termite infestations or high humidity?
                </p>
                <div class="answerContainer">
                    <div>
                        <p class="faqAnswer">Our German and Swiss specialists have developed a timber construction method that is ideally suited for Africa. The challenge of termites is addressed both in terms of processing and construction techniques. The wood is dried to 8% moisture content, which termites do not like at all. Additionally, the wooden walls are designed in such a way that they are protected from pest infestations even after construction. When you visit Zanzibar, we would be happy to take you on a tour of the production facility.</p>
